----- IT IS REQUIRED TO IMPORT THE DATABASE 'social_meet.sql' OR ELSE NONE OF THE CODE WILL FUNCTION. -----

----- XAMPP and MySql IS ALSO REQUIRED -----

Step 1: Download and move the `socialmeet` folder with all of its child files into C:/xampp/htdocs

Step 2: Import the `socialmeet.sql` into your SQL databases on XAMPP:

To import the `socialmeet.sql` file on your XAMPP, you can follow these steps:

1. Copy the `socialmeet.sql` file to your computer.
2. Start the XAMPP Control Panel on your computer and make sure that the MySQL server is running.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the XAMPP installation directory. For example, on Windows, you can type `cd C:\xampp\mysql\bin`.
4. Run the following command to import the SQL file:

```
mysql -u [username] -p socialmeet < path/to/socialmeet.sql
```

Replace `[username]` with your MySQL username (root by default) and `path/to/socialmeet.sql` with the path to the `socialmeet.sql` file on your computer.

5. Enter your MySQL password when prompted.

After running this command, the `socialmeet` database and its tables should be imported into your XAMPP MySQL server and the code should function as intended.


To access you need to keep XAMPP open with the MySQL server running, and you can access through the following link:
http://localhost/socialmeet/login.php
